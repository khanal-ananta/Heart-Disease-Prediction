# Heart-Disease-Prediction

About
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.


Attribute Information:

> 1.age = age in years

> 2.sex= (1 = male; 0 = female)

> 3.cp = chest pain type

> 4.trestbpsr = esting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

> 5.chol = serum cholestoral in mg/dl

> 6.fbs = (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

> 7.restecg = resting electrocardiographic results

> 8.thalach = maximum heart rate achieved

> 9.exang = exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

> 10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

> 11.slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

> 12.ca = number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

> 13.thal = 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
